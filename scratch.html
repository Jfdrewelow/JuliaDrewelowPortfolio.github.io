	<h1>Name Assignment</h1>
		<p>
			<img src="images/nameProject.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
		</p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		
		<p>
		I used scratch to design and create a program that shows my name.
		The requirements were to add a sprite for each letter in my name 
		and then give them 3 unique behaviors. The program needed to run 
		when the green flag was clicked and for extra credit I added a 
		function to reset the scene to the beginning each time the green 
		flag was clicked.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
				<li>Using event blocks - green flag clicked, when key pressed, when sprite clicked</li>
				<li>Conditional statements - used if statements</li>
				<li>Used loops - I used a forever block to keep the sprite constantly moving</li>
				<li>Sprites - I created my own sprites using the sprite editor, I used the library of sprites to find letters in my name and adjusted the color</li>
				<li>Movement - I used the x and y values to make my sprites move to their original location when the green flag was clicked, I also rotated the sprites</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h1>Computer Buying Project</h1>
		<p>
			<img src="images/computerBuyingProject.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
		</p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		
		<p>
		I used scratch, my own knowledge and some research to pick an appropriate computer for the person we interviewed. The requirements were to pick someone to interview 
		 then create a scratch slideshow that appropriately described and picked the best computer for that person. We had to follow a rubric and make sure that all appropriate 
		 information was included. My group also had to present in front of the class. A citation needed to be included.
		</p>
		
		
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
				<li>How to conduct proper research - We had to create a citation with adequate sources</li>
				<li>How to create a slide show in scratch</li>
				<li>Using event blocks - green flag clicked, when key pressed, when sprite clicked</li>
				<li>Inserting pictures from the web</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h1>Final Project</h1>
		<p>
			<img src="images/finalProject.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
		</p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		
		<p>
		In the final project I created a game from all the skills I learned, and all of my prior knowledge. We needed to closely follow the guidelines and mkae sure we had everything checked off on 
		the rubric. The game needed to have at least 2 levels, and it needed to tell you when you won or lost. You needed to include instructions for the person playing the game.  
		</p>

				<li>Conditional satements - used if statements</li>
				<li>Used loops - I used a forever block to keep the sprite constantly moving</li>
				<li>Sprites - I selected a sprite and edited the size and color</li>
				<li>Movement - I used the x and y values to make my sprites move to random spots on the screen</li>
